# Heavenly_Helpings

- The **Heavenly Helpings** project aims to develop a user-friendly website that allows individuals to easily search for the nearest temple or alternative subsidiary food shop for their alms giving needs. With the increasing number of people seeking assistance with food, this platform serves as a valuable resource for those who wish to contribute to this virtuous act.

- The website's primary feature is its search functionality, which enables users to locate the nearest temples in their vicinity. By simply entering their location or using geolocation services, users can instantly access a list of nearby temples. Each temple's profile provides detailed information, including its address, contact details, and operating hours, allowing users to make informed decisions based on their preferences and convenience.

- In instances where no temples are available nearby, the website intelligently suggests subsidiary food shops that offer alms at a relatively lower cost compared to regular food shops. These shops are carefully selected to ensure that the quality of the food remains high while keeping the cost affordable. By offering this alternative option, the platform ensures that individuals in need can still receive assistance even in areas without accessible temples.

- Overall, the **Heavenly Helpings** project represents a powerful tool for both individuals seeking alms and those wishing to contribute. By creating a user-friendly website that incorporates advanced search capabilities and an intelligent subsidiary food shop recommendation system, the platform bridges the gap between those in need and the resources available to them. With its comprehensive features and streamlined functionality, this project aims to promote the noble act of alms giving and foster a more compassionate society.
